A pack of lo-fi speaker impulse responses, captured from various devices, such as various small size loud speakers, headphones, garnitures, a modern tablet and a smartphone. Feel free to use for any purpose. Credit is optional.

Captured with Shure C606N and Behringer U-Phoria UMC204, in a quite noisy environment.
